# Advent Of Code 2015

My solutions to the [2015 Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2015) puzzles.

I did not participate to the challenge in 2015 (my first was in 2019) but in January 2020 I decided it would have been fun (and good practice) to try to solve them in my spare time.

## Things I learned or noticed on the way

* Puzzles seems easier then 2019 or 2020 (but let's wait for the finale!)
* I got better at algorithms!
* I still suck at using rexexp, my scraping of the input files are often messier then they could be (even if I can now use better list comprehension)
* `itertools` FTW!
* Brute force can be the solution if the input is not too large (but not always!)

  * Part 2: 2020-02-13: toughest puzzle to date, final solution was trivial but I suspect it works only because of peculiarities of replacement "grammar".
